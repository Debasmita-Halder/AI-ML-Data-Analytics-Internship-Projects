🏠 House Price Prediction Website
📌 Overview

This project is a House Price Prediction Website that leverages Machine Learning to estimate housing prices based on multiple factors such as:

🛋️ Number of rooms

📍 Location

📏 Area/size of the house

🏗️ Other property features

The website provides users with an interactive interface to input property details and instantly receive a predicted price.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python – Core programming language

Flask – Web framework for building the website

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning library used for model training/testing

Pandas & NumPy – Data processing and manipulation

HTML/CSS – Frontend structure and design

🧠 Machine Learning Model

The model was trained using Linear Regression to predict housing prices.

Steps followed:

📊 Data Collection & Cleaning – Preprocessed housing dataset with features like rooms, location, and area.

🔎 Feature Selection – Selected key features impacting house price.

🤖 Model Training – Trained a Linear Regression model on the dataset.

🧪 Model Testing – Evaluated performance using test data.

🌐 Deployment – Integrated model into a Flask-based web app for user interaction.


✨ Features
